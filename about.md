      <p>I'm Andy Chipperfield, and I've been a UX/UI designer full-time since 2007. Previous to that I worked for 7 years in the City of London as a catastrophe modeller. I quit that job to do what I love. I first coded HTML in notepad in 1999. </p>

        <p>Outside of digital design, I like to woodburn and sell unique items of pyrography in my shop <a href="http://burncraft.co">Burncraft</a>. I love craft beer (particularly a Porter, if we ever meet), and have a large soft spot for Bourbon. The family and I are in the pool to emigrate to the beautiful Vancouver in 2015, which is where we're hoping to spend the rest of our lives.</p>
