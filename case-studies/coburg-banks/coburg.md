        <h1>Coburg Banks</h1>
        <h3>Coburg Banks are a recruitment firm based in the Midlands</h3>
        <p>I was asked to plan out their current site architecture, and propose a new one for their 2 main personas. After that wireframes were produced for each of these pages. This project is on going, so will update with the UI design when it becomes available.</p>
