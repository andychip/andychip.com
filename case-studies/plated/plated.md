        <h3>Established in 2012, Plated are a subscription based food delivery company based in New York</h3>
        <p>I was integrated into the Plated design team with the task of designing landing pages and simplifying their checkout flow. One of the key elements that was implemented from my designs, was to shorten checkout forms as much as possible and to pre-fill as much information as we could. </p>
