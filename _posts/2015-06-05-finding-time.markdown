<p>Everyone has exactly 24 hours in their day. It's how we allocate that time which is important. Allocation will change as life changes, and consequently, priorities. </p>
<p>Whatever is the most important to you, allocate time to that first. Family, reading, running, making stuff; whatever it is, it goes in first. Follow the chain down until your spare time is full. After a month, look at it again. Not enjoying running in the winter? Make more stuff instead, or add something new.</p>

<p>Your priorities aren't set for life. They change.</p>

<h2>We all have the same amount of time each day to do with as we please. Find time for your priorities.</h2>
