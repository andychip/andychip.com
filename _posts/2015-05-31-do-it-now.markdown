<p>Gradually as I've got older, I've realised I'm saying the same thing a lot more: <b>"I wish I'd done this sooner"</b>.</p>
<p>Some take it or leave it advice, whatever you've been putting off, don't wait any longer. If it's something negative, it'll be over quicker; if it's something positive you'll have a lot longer to enjoy it.
