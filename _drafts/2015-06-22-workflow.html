<p>I know that a designers workflow can be as personal as your view on <a href="http://uninvitedredesigns.com/">unsolicited redesigns</a>, or the neverending discussions on <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2015/04/should-designers-learn-to-code/">whether designers should be able to code</a> (they should, btw). </p>
<p>I don't think you should follow a top designers workflow (or mine) just because you admire the work they produce, or because of some passive attraction to their status in the community. Each persons workflow is unique to the work they are required, or want, to produce.</p>
<p>Most of my work involves new products, so for now I'll leave out user feedback, and data analysis, but know that these are important if you're working with an existing site, app or product.</p>

<p>My workflow is generally the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#businessobjectives">Business objectives</a></li>
  <li><a href="#redroutes">Red routes</a></li>
  <li><a href="#personas">Personas</a></li>
  <li><a href="#userflows">User flows</a></li>
  <li><a href="#informationarcitecture">Information Architecture</a></li>
  <li><a href="#wireframes">Wireframes</a></li>
  <li><a href="#prototyping">Prototyping</a></li>
  <li><a href="#uidesign">UI Design</a></li>
  <li><a href="#frontendcoding">Front-end coding</a></li>
  <li><a href="#speedenhancement">Speed enhancements</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="businessobjectives">Business Objectives</h3>

<h3 id="redroutes">Red routes</h3>

<h3 id="personas">Personas</h3>

<h3 id="userflows">User flows</h3>

<h3 id="informationarcitecture">Information Architecture</h3>

<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
<p>For web and app UI, in my opinion, wireframes are the best UX document you can provide your client with. You can cut down on a lot of wasted time in the UI Design stage by making sure the layout is locked down. It provides the client with an opportunity to make sure the content is all there and with a heirarchy.</p>

<h3 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h3>
<p>Prototyping interactions has been a revelation for client approvals in the recent past. It makes it so much easier to show the client what will occur rather than leaving it to some copy and their imagination</p>

<p>In the last year or so, there have been a number of prototyping tools come to market. I've tried a few and so far landed on <a href="https://invisionapp.com">Invision</a> for static prototyping and <a href="https://framerjs.com">FramerJS</a> for more complex problems involving animations.</p>

<h3 id="uidesign">UI Design</h3>
<p>For UI I use <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> predominantly. Not only is it lightweight and built for UI, but there is an awesome community built around it, much more so than any I've seen built around Adobe products in the 16 years I've been using them. </p>

<h3 id="frontendcoding">Front-end coding</h3>
<p>My front-end coding mainly involves HTML and CSS, with a little Javascript thrown in. I have some favourite tools I use, plus some I'm trying to learn. I used to use <a href="http://panic.com/coda">Coda</a> and <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/">Codekit</a> for my HTML and CSS, but lately have been using Atom as it compiles LESS and SASS without the need for a separate app. I have a certain love for LESS over SASS as it seems for designer-friendly to me, but picking up SASS seems to be easier using LESS as an easier introduction to understanding the basic structures.</p>
