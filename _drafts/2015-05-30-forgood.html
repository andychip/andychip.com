      <p>Here I'll say it; I'm fed up designing apps or websites for the next tinder; the next instagram. I want to do work that either helps people in need, or moves the human race forwards. I need to feel like I'm contributing to the greater good, and not adding to the noise that distracts us from what's really important; people, relationships and what we do with our lives.</p>
      <h2>Introducing forgood.io </h2>
      <p>forgood.io is a freelance collective which only works with organisations that correlate with this manifesto.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We will design and build your next app if helps those in poverty. </li>
          <li>We will make your website if it highlights the plight of child trafficking. </li>
          <li>We will not make your next app if it adds filters to photos. </li>
          <li>We will not make your website if it encourages people to buy more pairs of socks. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Get the idea?</p>
